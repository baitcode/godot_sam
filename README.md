#Super Animation:
Super Animation Format is a custom export format for flash animations. 
The cocos2d-x loader for the format is opensource but the exporter is not 
open source. You can find the project here:

#Why SAM?
There are a bunch of other tools that do the same thing. 
Alternatives include GAF, DragonBones, SWiffy and many more i might not know about.
The reason i picked SAM format is because of the simplicity of the format and i have worked a lot with it.
